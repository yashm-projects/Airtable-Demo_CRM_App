# Airtable CRM System

This project is a complete end-to-end CRM system built using Airtable. It includes structured tables, relational links, dashboards, automations, and a front-end interface for teams.

## 🔗 Live Airtable Base

📌 Sharing the Interface publicly requires an update to the team plan, whereas I am using the free version. You can check the screenshots below for the Interface. 

## 🔧 What’s Included

- Tables such as Contacts, Companies, Deals, Tasks, Notes, Proposals
- Linked record structure and normalized schema
- Interface Designer views for clean user interaction
- Automations for task tracking, status changes, and activity flags
- Built using 100% dummy data for safe sharing
